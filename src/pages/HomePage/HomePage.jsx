      <h1>Welcome to Crust & Crumb</h1>
      <p>Crust & Crumb is dedicated to the ancient art of sourdough bread making. We are a young site and we would love for you to come along for the journey as we grow. Right now you can log your starter and keep notes on it as it grows and changes, and also post photos of all your sour dough adventures. We have plans for the future that include recipies, forums, and much much more. Please join us for the ride.</p>
